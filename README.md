## [ RE:VERSE ]

### [ HARDWARE :: TEARDOWN ]

- Disassemble the device to inspect internal components and board layout.
- Perform a full Bill of Materials (BOM) reverse-engineering to identify all chips, passives, and connectors.
- Map the PCB layout, tracing signal paths, power domains, and key interfaces.
- Analyze serial communication lines (UART, SPI, I2C) for debugging and firmware upload.
- Locate and probe JTAG/SWD or other debug entry points for hardware access.
- Document all findings for firmware development, hardware interfacing, initial hardware / software hacking.

### [ DATA :: EXTRACTION ]

- Acquire official firmware file (.ptf)
  - .ptf = Intel HEX format file containing firmware data as ASCII lines with address and checksum.
- Convert Intel HEX to raw binary (.bin)
  - Tools: srec_cat or Python IntelHex library.
  - Verify data integrity using CRC or SHA-256 checksum.

### [ BINARY :: ANALYSIS ]
- Load binary into disassembler
  - Disassembler = tool that converts machine code to assembly instructions.
  - Set architecture to ARMv7-M, little-endian.
  - Define base load address according to vector table offset.
- Define memory segments
  - .text = code segment where executable instructions reside.
  - .data = initialized data segment for global variables with preset values.
  - .bss = uninitialized data segment for global variables zeroed at startup.
  - .rodata = read-only data segment for constants and strings.
- Identify vector table
  - Vector table = table of pointers to interrupt and reset handlers at fixed low memory addresses.
  - Extract reset handler address for entry point reference.
- Extract reset handler and startup routines
  - Reset handler = first code executed after reset or power-on.
  - Startup code = routines that initialize stack pointer, copy .data, zero .bss, then call main().

### [ DATA :: OVERRIDE ]
- Identify standard library functions
  - Locate memcpy, memset, strcpy patterns by signature or string references.
- Map interrupt service routines (ISRs)
  - ISR = function executed in response to hardware event.
  - Match vector entries to disassembled functions.
- Identify memory-mapped I/O access
  - Peripheral registers = fixed addresses controlling hardware modules.
  - Search load/store instructions targeting known peripheral base addresses (GPIO, I2C, SPI, USB, DMA).
- Document DMA and buffer usage
  - DMA = Direct Memory Access, hardware engine moving data without CPU.
  - Identify DMA channel configuration and buffer descriptors for audio and USB.
- Map audio engine routines
  - PCM playback = Pulse-Code Modulation audio output.
  - Locate buffer refill and DAC/I2S transfer routines.

### [ DATA FORMATS :: DUMP ]
- Extract .pti instrument format structure
  - Header length and field offsets for envelope, loop points, sample length.
  - CRC32 = cyclic redundancy check for data integrity.
- Extract .mtp pattern format
  - Fixed-size record containing note events, effect commands, and timing data.
- Extract .mt project format
  - Sequence of pattern indices representing song arrangement.

### [ MAIN :: REWRITE :: PHASE ]
- Set up development framework
  - Choose language: Rust no_std or C with CMSIS and vendor HAL.
  - Initialize project with correct linker script matching memory map.
- Implement startup code
  - Copy .data, zero .bss, configure stack pointer.
  - Set up vector table and NVIC.
- Implement peripheral drivers
  - GPIO driver for pad matrix and encoders.
  - SPI driver for display interface.
  - SD card driver with FAT or custom FS parser.
  - USB driver for mass storage and debug interface.
- Implement core modules
  - Sequencer module: step counter, pattern pointer, tempo generator.
  - Audio module: sample buffer management, mixing, DAC output.
  - UI module: draw primitives on display, handle encoder input, menu navigation.
  - File module: parse .pti/.mtp/.mt formats into memory structures.
- Integrate modules and test
  - Unit test functions in simulator or dev board.
  - End-to-end test: load instrument, play pattern, display output, respond to input.

### [ BINARY :: PATCHING ]
- Add logging interface via UART or USB CDC
- Measure timing jitter and buffer underruns
- Optimize critical loops with assembly or DMA chaining
- Verify memory usage and adjust stack/heap sizes

### [ END USERS :: QOL ]
- Prepare build scripts and CI pipeline
- Write developer documentation for each module and data format
- Release source code under open-source license
- Provide flashable binaries and usage guide

## [ RE:WRITE ]

- Make an initial MVP firmware that can run on the Tracker OG, released as open-source firmware.
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Flash at your own risk!**

- Build a **fully independent, open-source firmware** for the Tracker OG
- Restore and enhance the user experience
- Prioritize **modularity**, **transparency**, and **user control**
- Respect the hardware by unleashing its true capabilities

This is not a clone of Polyend‚Äôs firmware. This is a fresh start.

---

## [ RE:SHIELD ]

This firmware is:
- Developed from scratch using clean-room practices
- Free from Polyend code, documentation, or proprietary internals
- Openly licensed for community contribution and use

I do not:
- Publish or reverse-engineer Polyend's firmware code or binaries
- Reproduce or document proprietary system internals
- Use Polyend trademarks in the firmware name or binaries

This project operates under fair-use and user rights to modify or replace software on legally owned hardware.

## [ RE:BIRTH ]

Contributors, testers, hardware explorers, and curious minds are welcome. If you love the Tracker OG but feel abandoned, this is your new home.

I'll do what Polyend didn‚Äôt: **support the device properly**.

Stay tuned for roadmap, architecture, and contribution guides.

## [ RE:VENGE ]

**Let‚Äôs bring the Tracker OG back to life. One byte at a time.**
